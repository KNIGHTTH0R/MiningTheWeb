##Follow these instructions: 
###https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

---
##To Download the code for class (only do this once): 
###`git clone https://github.com/datapolitan/MiningTheWeb.git`

---
#From now on

##To Get Updates: `git pull`

##To Make a Commit: 

+ ###If the file hasn't been added to the repository: `git add filename.ext`
+ ###Once the file has been added: `git commit -am 'commit message'`

---

##To Create a Branch: `git checkout -b branch_name`

##To Push Commit to Github (remote server): `git push`
##To Push Commit to Branch: `git push --set-upstream origin branch_name`
(Don't worry, git will remind you of this)

---

#The Workflow for Assignments

```bash
#get any changes in the repository
git fetch 
#checkout the main gh-pages branch
git checkout gh-pages 
#pull any commits in the gh-pages branch
git pull 
#checkout your own branch on your local machine to do your assignment
git checkout -b lastName_assignment 
#write some awesome code and save the text file
#commit your awesome code to your local branch
git commit -am 'my awesome code' 
#push your awesome code to Github
git push --set-upstream origin lastName_assignment 
```

---

##You submit your work with a pull request

###On the [Github page](https://github.com/datapolitan/MiningTheWeb)

![img-full](../images/github_pull.png)

###After clicking the pull request button above click "Create Pull Request"

![img-full](../images/github_pull2.png)

---

##Describe the request with your name and what you're submitting and click "Create pull request"

![img-full](../images/github_pull3.png)

---

#Do It Now

###Write a short introduction to yourself and post it onto the group page using the workflow we just outlined

```bash
#get any changes in the repository
git fetch 
#checkout the main gh-pages branch
git checkout gh-pages 
#pull any commits in the gh-pages branch
git pull 
#checkout your own branch on your local machine to do your assignment
git checkout -b lastName_assignment 
#write some awesome code and save the text file
#commit your awesome code to your local branch
git commit -am 'my awesome code' 
#push your awesome code to Github
git push --set-upstream origin lastName_assignment 
```

#Assignment - Visualization Critique 1
##Complete the visualization started in class with data from an open data portal. Style the map in CartoDB and embed your visualization into the class page with short descriptive text on where you found the data, what you did to visualize the data, and any thoughts on what you've created.

---

#Assignment - Project 1
##Find an interesting or visually compelling visualization online and write 2-3 paragraphs on the visualization, discussing the data source(s), the visual style, and how well the data was represented. Feel free to use the visualization resources listed above. Submit your text to the class page following the example shown.

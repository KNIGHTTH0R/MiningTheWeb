#Setup Git for this class

`git clone https://github.com/datapolitan/MiningTheWeb.git`

---
##To Get Updates: `git pull`

##To Make a Commit: 

+ ###If the file hasn't been added to the repository: `git add filename.ext`
+ ###Once the file has been added: `git commit -am 'commit message'`

---

##To Create a Branch: `git checkout -b branch_name`

##To Push Commit to Github (remote server): `git push`
##To Push Commit to Branch: `git push --set-upstream origin branch_name`
(Don't worry, git will remind you of this)

---

#The Workflow for Projects

```bash
#get any changes in the repository
git fetch 
#checkout the main gh-pages branch
git checkout gh-pages 
#pull any commits in the gh-pages branch
git pull 
#checkout your own branch on your local machine to do your assignment
git checkout -b lastName_assignment 
#commit your awesome code to your local branch
git commit -am 'my awesome code' 
#push your awesome code to Github
git push --set-upstream origin lastName_assignment 
```

---

##You submit your work with a pull request

###On the [Github page](https://github.com/datapolitan/MiningTheWeb)

![img-full](../images/github_pull.png)

###After clicking the pull request button above click "Create Pull Request"

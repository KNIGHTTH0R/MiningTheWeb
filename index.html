        Project Page</h2>
      <h3>Guidelines for assignment submission</h3>
      <p>We will be using this page to submit assignments. Write up your visualization critiques using the "vis-critique" class and "project" class for your CartoDB visualizations, following the examples below. </p>

<div class='project'>
  <h3> Homework - a) production of map </h3>
  <p> Using CardoDB, I created the following map: <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://yknoepfel.cartodb.com/viz/30581046-5e6d-11e5-a396-0e853d047bba/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe> which displays the abandoned buildings in Boston. I intended to create a second layer with the data of the crime report in order to see if there if crime happens more often in proximity of abandoned buildings. The data set could not be read by CardoDB (did not recognize geocoding). </p> 
  </div>

  <div class='vis-critique'>
<h3>Homework - b) visualization critique </h3>
<p> On <a> href="http://aleppo.firstmilegeo.com/" target="_blank">Tableau Public</a> I found this map showing the development of ISIS influence on Aleppo from October 2013 until May 2014. While the interactity of the map might be useful to show how different areas of the city change, the term «influence» is not defined (e.g. attacks, control, support). It is also likely that several political forces are operating and borders can't be drawn clearly. A geographical scale is missing, and it would be interesting to see how the population is distributed in the city to get a bigger picture of the situation.</p>

      <h3>Chicago Sanitation Compliants - Megan Hubel</h3>
      <p>This data set was all sanitation complaints (code 311) in the city of Chicago between 9/6/2015 and 9/13/2015. I was curious to know if there were any geographic trends for complaint frequency and the time duration for open complaints. If the city responded to a complaint (all green dots) then I included the number of days it took the city to respond in the hover label.</p>

      <h3>Visualizing Traffic Related Fatalities - Mark Yarish</h3>
      Here is my CartoDB visualization using Vision Zero data and the Nokia Day shapefiles. For this excercise, I filtered out only fatalties related to automobile accidents 9with fatalities) where a car hit either a pedistrian or a bicycle for the borough of Brooklyn:

      <h3>NYC Street Trees by Species map - Mark Yarish</h3>
      <p>This is an example visualization critique of a great visualization created by a web developer and designer, <a href="http://www.JillHubley.com" target="_blank">Jill Hubley</a>. In this map, Jill has made a visualization from the 2007 Street Tree Census Data <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Street-Tree-Census-Brooklyn-/ztcw-bzc8" target="_blank">Brooklyn Street Tree Data</a> using CartoDB, Leaflet, D3.js, and jQuery.</p>

      <h3>Traffic Cameras in Seattle - Andrew Hayias</h3>

      <p>This is my map of traffic cameras in Seattle, found using opendata and visualized with CartoDB. I used simple dots to represent the data, because I felt that knowing exactly where the cameras were located was important for the user. When clicking on each dot, it should tell you the address of the camera and have a link to a video if available.</p>

      <h3>Pankil Shah's Citibike Visualization - Andrew Hayias</h3>
        <p>For my visualization critique I used Pankil Shah's citi bike data visualization found on Tableau. It contains data for every citi bike station in New York City. The map looks at frequency between stations. It shows total number of trips, total miles, and the average trip time.</p>
        <p>I really like this visualization and the data it shows. The data gets rather detailed, showing which days and hours have the most traffic and even breaks it down by gender and age. One question I have is how the data on gender is actually collected.</p>

    	<h3>When do Americans leave for work + where the work commute is better or worse than yours</h3>
    	<p> <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2015/02/04/when-do-americans-leave-for-work/" target="_blank">This interactive heat map </a>  by Nathan Yau plots over a 24 hour period when commuting workers (anyone over the age of 16 who has a job) leave for work. With data sourced from the American Community Survey, it graphs at the county level the commuter population distributed by the time of commute. What's compelling about this map is that it clearly marks national trends in commutes (the highest percent of commuters leave between 7-8am, and the biggest density of those commuters are in the Midwest) as well as outliers (southwest Nevada has a lot of early-risers, and the citizens of the Aleutian Islands work a lot of night shifts). From the same survey and author, you can compare the quality of your commute to everyone else's: <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2015/02/05/where-the-commute-is-worse-and-better-than-yours//" target="_blank"> this commute is worse than yours. </a> This puts everything into perspective. When the user selects a county, the rest of the nation map re-colors to highlight how commutes in the rest of the country compare against the selected benchmark. By hovering over the compared counties, you can also see the average time difference for commutes.</p>

      <h3>Bars in NYC - Doh Y Jung</h3>
      <p><a href="http://lamp.sla.ny.gov/nysla/index.htm" target="_blank">This</a> was an example I found of bars distributed in NYC based on the Liquor license information. I found this to be a pretty poorly constructed map. First of all, it uses Flash. Secondly, crowded data points does not aggregate to help viewers get a better sense of the distribution. There is no legend explaining what each colors and symbols mean.
      <br>
      <br>

      So I tried to create a better version using cartodb.

      <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://djdoh88.cartodb.com/viz/47d4b280-5b19-11e5-bfe0-0ec6f7c8b2b9/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>

      <br>
      <br>

      Instead of showing all the locations with liquor store license, I've filtered down only what people would consider as "Bars" by filtering the license type. And I also excluded listings with no business names.

    <div class='project'>
      <h3>Visualizing @BrooklynBrewery Engagement - Doh Y Jung</h3>
      In keeping with the theme of bars, I first wanted to try using CartoDB with a dataset that I am familiar with. So from Brandwatch I exported all the "Engagement" (Retweet or At mention) data to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a>. This CartoDB map is showing geographically where people POST on Twitter reaching out to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      The static set of data was taken from the past 7 days (Sep 7th 2015 - Sep 13th 2015). I tried to provide certain level of interactivity by showing the actual tweet upon clicking dot representation. There was a intensity display through the green gradient.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you zoom into North America, you can see that more people tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a> from the East Coast, and globally the brand seems to have some traction from the U.K.

      <h3> Introduction Doh Y Jung</h3>
      <p> Hello, my name is Doh. And I am a good example of why you should not miss class because I've done this assignment in so many different wrong ways. I currently work for a social media analytics company calld Brandwatch as a data analyst. After learning a thing or two about python, pandas and matplotlib, I wanted to learn more about Data Visualziation, particularly how to map things!<p>

      <h3>Map Hacking the Sisyphyus Subway map - Richard Dunks</h3>
      <p>This is an example visualization critique of a great visualization created by the master of interactive visualization and design, <a href="http://www.datapolitan.com" target="_blank">Richard Dunks</a>. In this latest incarnation, he has remade a visualization from the <a href="http://cbcny.org" target="_blank">Citizens Budget Commission</a> using CartoDB, Leaflet, D3.js, and jQuery. While the <a href="http://interactive.cbcny.org/nyct-station-conditions" target="_blank">original visualization</a> showed the data in an interactive format using <a href="http://public.tableau.com" target ="_blank">Tableau Public</a>, Richard created a custom JavaScript map and was able to better display the data, providing multiple data layers and better interactivity with the data.</p>

        <h3>Critique 1 - Angelo Jack</h3>
        <p> I found this map of world Facebook usage. The color palate of this particular map is clear and straightforward with good contrasts. The transparent layering helps to gives some depth to the data. How the information displayed allows the context to emerge as we can begin to discern geographic regions and countries.</p>
        <p>Allowing the data to inform the map's shape and bounties is effective in this visualization. Spatial context emerges from the data; no need to use political border lines to guide the reader.

      <h3>Mapping the U.S. by Property Value Instead of Land Area - Markese Lavell Wider</h3>
      <p>My visualization critique is of a great visualization created by <a href="http://metrocosm.com/author/mgalka/" target="_blank">Max Galka</a>. Max Galka created a cartogram of the residential property value for every county in the United States (the contiguous 48 states).<br> <br> Max Galka created this cartogram using Carto3F. I am particularly intrigued by this visualization because without any information about what you are looking at it looks like some type of wild science experiment but with a little information provided this map tells a great story. From this map you can tell that most of the residential property value is located in a few concentrated areas in the United states.  </p>
      <p>You can see the full map <a href="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/07/usa_housing_value/a14063e6e.png" target="_blank">here</a>, an animated GIF<a href="http://metrocosm.com/web/map-property-values-usa.gif" target="_blank"> here </a>, and the full story <a href="http://www.citylab.com/housing/2015/07/mapping-the-us-by-property-value-instead-of-land-area/397841/" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <h3>Visualizing Free Wi-fi Hotspot locations in New York City - Markese Lavell Wider</h3>
      Here is my awesome CartoDB visualization using information provided via the NYC OpenData website. In this visualization you are able to see where free Wi-fi Hotspots are located in the city of New York as well as where they are clustered. I chose to use the Dark matter basemap and purple markers outlined with white in order to make the locations pop.

      <h3>Art Galleries and Subway Line - Allen Shaibani</h3>
      <p>The following visualization is of Art galleries and the subway line. Both datasets were found on the NYC OpenData portal. <br>
      <br>
      It could use a sort of walkability layer as well, but this may require 3rd party code. The walkability will assess how far from gallery to subway stop.</p>

      <br>
      This visualization alters the scale of countries in relation to their position on a Mercator projection. 
      The visualization uses a light base map that offers information on countries and to an extent, states and provinces. The boundaries are fine yet gentle, allowing for continues movement among the selected country, while maintaining autonomy.
      The selected countries, however, are shown with strong colors, semi-transparent and pronouncing. If the user selects more than one country, a different strong color will represent the second and so on.

      <h3>When do Americans leave for work + where the work commute is better or worse than yours - Megan Hubel</h3>
      <p> <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2015/02/04/when-do-americans-leave-for-work/" target="_blank">This interactive heat map </a>  by Nathan Yau plots over a 24 hour period when commuting workers (anyone over the age of 16 who has a job) leave for work. With data sourced from the American Community Survey, it graphs at the county level the commuter population distributed by the time of commute. What's compelling about this map is that it clearly marks national trends in commutes (the highest percent of commuters leave between 7-8am, and the biggest density of those commuters are in the Midwest) as well as outliers (southwest Nevada has a lot of early-risers, and the citizens of the Aleutian Islands work a lot of night shifts). From the same survey and author, you can compare the quality of your commute to everyone else's: <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2015/02/05/where-the-commute-is-worse-and-better-than-yours//" target="_blank"> this commute is worse than yours. </a> This puts everything into perspective. When the user selects a county, the rest of the nation map re-colors to highlight how commutes in the rest of the country compare against the selected benchmark. By hovering over the compared counties, you can also see the average time difference for commutes.</p>

      <h3>Chicago Sanitation Compliants - Megan Hubel</h3>
      <p>This data set was all sanitation complaints (code 311) in the city of Chicago between 9/6/2015 and 9/13/2015. I was curious to know if there were any geographic trends for complaint frequency and the time duration for open complaints. If the city responded to a complaint (all green dots) then I included the number of days it took the city to respond in the hover label.</p>

      <h3> Visualization Critique - Yvonne Knoepfel </h3>
      <p> Using CardoDB, I created the following map: <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://yknoepfel.cartodb.com/viz/30581046-5e6d-11e5-a396-0e853d047bba/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe> which displays the abandoned buildings in Boston. I intended to create a second layer with the data of the crime report in order to see if there if crime happens more often in proximity of abandoned buildings. The data set could not be read by CardoDB (did not recognize geocoding). </p>

      <h3>ISIS Influence - Yvonne Knoepfel </h3>
      <p> On <a href="http://aleppo.firstmilegeo.com/" target="_blank">Tableau Public</a> I found this map showing the development of ISIS influence on Aleppo from October 2013 until May 2014. While the interactity of the map might be useful to show how different areas of the city change, the term «influence» is not defined (e.g. attacks, control, support). It is also likely that several political forces are operating and borders can't be drawn clearly. A geographical scale is missing, and it would be interesting to see how the population is distributed in the city to get a bigger picture of the situation.</p>

      <h3>Visualizing Traffic Related Fatalities - Mark Yarish</h3>
      Here is my CartoDB visualization using Vision Zero data and the Nokia Day shapefiles. For this excercise, I filtered out only fatalties related to automobile accidents 9with fatalities) where a car hit either a pedistrian or a bicycle for the borough of Brooklyn:

      <p>This is an example visualization critique of a great visualization created by a web developer and designer, <a href="http://www.JillHubley.com" target="_blank">Jill Hubley</a>. In this map, Jill has made a visualization from the 2007 Street Tree Census Data <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Street-Tree-Census-Brooklyn-/ztcw-bzc8" target="_blank">Brooklyn Street Tree Data</a> using CartoDB, Leaflet, D3.js, and jQuery.</p>

      <h3>Traffic Cameras in Seattle - Andrew Hayias</h3>
      <p>This is my map of traffic cameras in Seattle, found using opendata and visualized with CartoDB. I used simple dots to represent the data, because I felt that knowing exactly where the cameras were located was important for the user. When clicking on each dot, it should tell you the address of the camera and have a link to a video if available.</p>

      <h3>Pankil Shah's Citibike Visualization - Andrew Hayias</h3>
      <p>For my visualization critique I used Pankil Shah's citi bike data visualization found on Tableau. It contains data for every citi bike station in New York City. The map looks at frequency between stations. It shows total number of trips, total miles, and the average trip time.</p>
      <p>I really like this visualization and the data it shows. The data gets rather detailed, showing which days and hours have the most traffic and even breaks it down by gender and age. One question I have is how the data on gender is actually collected.</p>

      <h3>Bars in NYC - Doh Y Jung</h3>
      <p><a href="http://lamp.sla.ny.gov/nysla/index.htm" target="_blank">This</a> was an example I found of bars distributed in NYC based on the Liquor license information. I found this to be a pretty poorly constructed map. First of all, it uses Flash. Secondly, crowded data points does not aggregate to help viewers get a better sense of the distribution. There is no legend explaining what each colors and symbols mean.
      <br>
      <br>
      So I tried to create a better version using cartodb.
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      Instead of showing all the locations with liquor store license, I've filtered down only what people would consider as "Bars" by filtering the license type. And I also excluded listings with no business names.

      <h3>Visualizing @BrooklynBrewery Engagement - Doh Y Jung</h3>
      In keeping with the theme of bars, I first wanted to try using CartoDB with a dataset that I am familiar with. So from Brandwatch I exported all the "Engagement" (Retweet or At mention) data to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a>. This CartoDB map is showing geographically where people POST on Twitter reaching out to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      The static set of data was taken from the past 7 days (Sep 7th 2015 - Sep 13th 2015). I tried to provide certain level of interactivity by showing the actual tweet upon clicking dot representation. There was a intensity display through the green gradient.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you zoom into North America, you can see that more people tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a> from the East Coast, and globally the brand seems to have some traction from the U.K.

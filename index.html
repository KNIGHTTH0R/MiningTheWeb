      <h3>A Colorful Dot Map of America's Immigrants - Markese Lavell Wider</h3>
      <p>My visualization critique is of a great dot density map created by <a href="http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/" target="_blank">Kyle E. Walker, Ph.D.</a>. Kyle Walker created a collection of dot density maps represetning immigrant populations in some of the major cities in the United States. To create these maps data was collected from the census at the census tract level. Walker choose to represent the immigrants according to colors which represents the regions of the world from which they originate. I particuallry like the choice of colors used to represent the immigrants and the simple base map because it allows for the data to be clearly seen and creates an appealing visual that is very understandable. I particularly like how the maps go beyond the boundaries of the cities and into the greater metroplitian areas so that you are able to see where immigrant groups may be concentrated outside of the city and makes you think about why those areas are drawing those populations. I love looking at these collection of maps because it tells you how all cities are diffent and how they all have unique cultural footprints created by immigrant populations. <br>   </p>

      <h3>Map Hacking the Sisyphyus Subway map - Richard Dunks</h3>
      <p>This is an example visualization critique of a great visualization created by the master of interactive visualization and design, <a href="http://www.datapolitan.com" target="_blank">Richard Dunks</a>. In this latest incarnation, he has remade a visualization from the <a href="http://cbcny.org" target="_blank">Citizens Budget Commission</a> using CartoDB, Leaflet, D3.js, and jQuery. While the <a href="http://interactive.cbcny.org/nyct-station-conditions" target="_blank">original visualization</a> showed the data in an interactive format using <a href="http://public.tableau.com" target ="_blank">Tableau Public</a>, Richard created a custom JavaScript map and was able to better display the data, providing multiple data layers and better interactivity with the data.</p>
      <p>You can see <a href="http://www.datapolitan.com/mta_station_repair_status/" target="_blank">the full map here</a> and a <a href="http://wp.me/p2PLpM-1QD" target="_blank">blogpost about the map here</a>.

      <h3>Guidelines for assignment submission</h3>
      <p>We will be using this page to submit assignments. Write up your visualization critiques using the "vis-critique" class and "project" class for your CartoDB visualizations, following the examples below. </p>

      <h3> Introduction Doh Y Jung</h3>
      <p> Hello, my name is Doh. And I am a good example of why you should not miss class because I've done this assignment in so many different wrong ways. I currently work for a social media analytics company calld Brandwatch as a data analyst. After learning a thing or two about python, pandas and matplotlib, I wanted to learn more about Data Visualziation, particularly how to map things!<p>

      <h3>Bars in NYC - Doh Y Jung</h3>
      <p><a href="http://lamp.sla.ny.gov/nysla/index.htm" target="_blank">This</a> was an example I found of bars distributed in NYC based on the Liquor license information. I found this to be a pretty poorly constructed map. First of all, it uses Flash. Secondly, crowded data points does not aggregate to help viewers get a better sense of the distribution. There is no legend explaining what each colors and symbols mean.
      <br>
      <br>

      So I tried to create a better version using cartodb.

      <br>
      <br>

      Instead of showing all the locations with liquor store license, I've filtered down only what people would consider as "Bars" by filtering the license type. And I also excluded listings with no business names.

      <h3>Visualizing @BrooklynBrewery Engagement - Doh Y Jung</h3>
      In keeping with the theme of bars, I first wanted to try using CartoDB with a dataset that I am familiar with. So from Brandwatch I exported all the "Engagement" (Retweet or At mention) data to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a>. This CartoDB map is showing geographically where people POST on Twitter reaching out to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      The static set of data was taken from the past 7 days (Sep 7th 2015 - Sep 13th 2015). I tried to provide certain level of interactivity by showing the actual tweet upon clicking dot representation. There was a intensity display through the green gradient.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you zoom into North America, you can see that more people tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynbrewery" target="_blank">@BrooklynBrewery</a> from the East Coast, and globally the brand seems to have some traction from the U.K.

      <h3>Map Hacking the Sisyphyus Subway map - Richard Dunks</h3>
      <p>This is an example visualization critique of a great visualization created by the master of interactive visualization and design, <a href="http://www.datapolitan.com" target="_blank">Richard Dunks</a>. In this latest incarnation, he has remade a visualization from the <a href="http://cbcny.org" target="_blank">Citizens Budget Commission</a> using CartoDB, Leaflet, D3.js, and jQuery. While the <a href="http://interactive.cbcny.org/nyct-station-conditions" target="_blank">original visualization</a> showed the data in an interactive format using <a href="http://public.tableau.com" target ="_blank">Tableau Public</a>, Richard created a custom JavaScript map and was able to better display the data, providing multiple data layers and better interactivity with the data.</p>
      <p>You can see <a href="http://www.datapolitan.com/mta_station_repair_status/" target="_blank">the full map here</a> and a <a href="http://wp.me/p2PLpM-1QD" target="_blank">blogpost about the map here</a>.

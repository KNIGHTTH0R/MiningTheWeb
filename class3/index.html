#Introduction to Statistics

#Why Statistics?

---

#Why Statistics?
+ Tools for extracting meaning from data

---

#Why Statistics?
+ Tools for extracting meaning from data
+ Commonly understood ways of communicating meaning to others

---

#Histogram
+ Charts the frequency of instances in the data
+ Shows the frequency distribution
+ Values are grouped into class intervals
+ Best to have a consistent size to class intervals

#Distributions of Data

---

#Normal Distribution
![img-full](../images/dist_normal.png)

---

#Long-tail Distribution
![img-full](../images/dist_lt.png)

---

#Bi-Modal Distribution
![img-full](../images/dist_bm.png)

---

#Mean
+ A representative value for the data
+ Usually what people mean by “average”
+ Calculate by adding all the values together and dividing by the number instances
+ Sensitive to extremes

---

#Median
+ The “middle” value of a data set
+ Center value of a data set with an odd number of values
+ Sum of two middle values divided by 2 if the number of items in a data set is even
+ Resistant to extreme values
![img-full](../images/median_balance.png)

---

#Median vs Mean
![img-full](../images/mean_vs_median.png)

---

#Mode
+ The most frequent value in a dataset
+ Often used for categorical data
![img](../images/mode.png)

---

#Measures of Central Tendency
+ Quantitative data tends to cluster around some central value
+ Contrasts with the spread of data around that center (i.e. the variability in the data)
+ Mean is a more precise measure and more often used
+ Median is better when there are extreme outliers
+ Mode is used when the data is categorical (as opposed to numeric)

---

#Measuring Variability

---

#Range
+ The gap between the minimum value and the maximum value
+ Calculated by subtracting the minimum from the maximum

---

#Quantiles
+ Median splits the data set into two equal groups
+ Quartiles split the data into four equal groups
+ First quartile is 0-25% of the data
+ Second quartile is 25-50% of the data
+ Third quartile is 50-75% of the data
+ Fourth quartile is 75-100% of the data

---

#Interquartile Range
+ “Middle” 50% of data (between 1st Quartile and 3rd Quartile)
![img](../images/iqr.png)

---

#Outliers
+ Any data points less than 1.5x the IQR or greater than 1.5x the IQR are considered outliers
+ Helps identify data points that may skew the analysis
+ Focus on the “meat” of the data

---

#Outliers

---

#Standard Deviation
+ The average distance of each data point from the mean
+ Larger the standard deviation, the greater the spread
![img-full](../images/std1.png)

---

#Standard Deviation
![img-full](../images/std3.png)

---

#Formula for Standard Deviation
![img-full](../images/std2.png)

---

#Calculating the Standard Deviation
1. Subtract the mean from each data point
2. Square the result
3. Sum them together
4. Divide by the number of instances
5. Take the square root

...or you just use a computer
---

#Variance
1. Subtract the mean from each data point
2. Square the result
3. Sum them together
4. Divide by the number of instances
5. ~~Take the square root~~

---

#Measures of Variability
+ Describe the distribution of our data
+ Range (Maximum – Minimum)
+ Inter-quartile Range
+ Standard Deviation
+ Variance
+ Identification of outliers (1.5 x IQR)

---

#Descriptive Statistics
+ Quantitatively describe the main features of a dataset
+ Help distinguish distributions and make them comparable

---

#Exploratory Data Analysis
+ Goal -> Discover patterns in the data
+ Understand the context
+ Summarize fields
+ Use graphical representations of the data
+ Explore outliers

Tukey, J.W. (1977). Exploratory data analysis. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.

#Correlations
![img-full](../images/corr1.png)
How do we measure this relationship?

---

#Coefficient of Correlation
+ Quantifies the amount of shared variability between variables
+ Ranges between -1 and +1 
+ Negative numbers are inversely proportional
+ Positive numbers are directly proportional
+ The closer to either -1 or +1, the greater the correlation

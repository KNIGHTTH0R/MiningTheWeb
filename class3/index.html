#Why Statistics?

---

#Why Statistics?
+ Tools for extracting meaning from data

---

#Why Statistics?
+ Tools for extracting meaning from data
+ Commonly understood ways of communicating meaning to others

---

#Histogram
+ Charts the frequency of instances in the data
+ Shows the frequency distribution
+ Values are grouped into class intervals
+ Best to have a consistent size to class intervals

---

#Mean
+ A representative value for the data

#Mean
+ A representative value for the data
+ Usually what people mean by “average”
+ Calculate by adding all the values together and dividing by the number instances
